## Revolutionary Features

### Decentralized Gaming Identity Revolution
Moca Passport creates the first truly user-owned gaming identity that transcends platform boundaries, eliminating the fragmentation that has plagued the gaming industry for decades.

### Cross-Platform Achievement Unification
Our system automatically aggregates and verifies achievements, rankings, and accomplishments from every major gaming platform, creating a comprehensive skill and reputation profile that follows gamers everywhere.

### Privacy-Preserving Zero-Knowledge Verification
Leveraging cutting-edge cryptographic techniques, gamers can prove their credentials without exposing sensitive personal data, revolutionizing trust in gaming communities.

### Social Reputation Layer
A peer-to-peer endorsement system that captures the intangible qualities that make great teammates - communication, leadership, and sportsmanship - creating a holistic gaming reputation.

## Moca Stack Integration

### AIR Account Services Integration
**Status**: Fully Implemented (`/auth`, `hooks/useAirKit.ts`)

Our AIR Account Services integration provides:
- Seamless SSO authentication across the Animoca ecosystem
- Wallet-based identity management for true ownership
- Cross-platform compatibility with existing Web3 infrastructure
- Secure key management and identity verification

```typescript
// AIR Account Services Flow
User Authentication → Identity Creation → Credential Binding → Cross-Platform Access
```

### AIR Credential Services Implementation
**Status**: Work in Progress - Core Infrastructure

AIR Credential Services powers the revolutionary credential system:

    participant G as Gamer
    participant MP as Moca Passport
    participant ACS as AIR Credential Services
    participant GP as Gaming Platform
    participant MC as Moca Chain
    
    G->>MP: Connect Gaming Account
    MP->>GP: Fetch Achievements/Stats
    GP-->>MP: Return Verified Data
    MP->>ACS: Issue Verifiable Credential
    ACS->>MC: Store Credential Proof
    MC-->>ACS: Confirm Storage
    ACS-->>MP: Return Signed Credential
    MP-->>G: Display Verified Achievement
```

**Key Capabilities**:
- Automated credential issuance for gaming achievements
- Cryptographically signed proof of accomplishments
- Tamper-proof credential verification
- Interoperable credential format across Moca ecosystem
- Real-time achievement validation and updates

### Moca Chain Integration
**Status**: Work in Progress - Blockchain Infrastructure

Moca Chain serves as the decentralized backbone ensuring:

**Immutable Credential Registry**
- Permanent, tamper-proof storage of achievement proofs
- Prevention of duplicate or fraudulent credentials
- Cross-game interoperability within Animoca ecosystem

**Sybil Attack Prevention**
- Unique identity verification across all platforms
- Prevention of multi-account exploitation
- Robust anti-cheating mechanisms

**Decentralized Verification Network**
